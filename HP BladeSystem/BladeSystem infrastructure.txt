0. What Virtual Connect is not
==============================
Virtual Connect isn’t a switch, isn’t part of the network, and
it doesn’t control anything in the network. 
And those are all good things. 
Data center Ethernet switches are complicated machines.
They’re part of a complex network of switches and routers
in which every change needs to be controlled
by a LAN or SAN administrator 
with special skills and insights into that network. 
Likewise, the server infrastructure is a complicated
system that demands the special skills and insights of
the system administrator.
Virtual Connect allows servers to connect to the network
in a way that doesn’t affect the network at all. 
So the system administrator can add new servers, make server changes, and
manage Virtual Connect without the network administrator needing to get involved.

1. Overcoming rigid capacity per NIC
====================================
HP created Flex-10 technology to deal with the issue of 1Gb/s - 10Gb/s rigidity.
To get those same eight NICs and four redundant networks using Flex-10,
you don’t need any mezzanine cards and 
you only need two Virtual Connect Flex-10/10D or Virtual Connect FlexFabric interconnect modules in the enclosure.
Therefore, you only have to buy two modules instead of eight.

2. Converged Ethernet and Fibre Channel
=======================================
But you can eliminate even more hardware if you converge Ethernet and Fibre Channel onto a single FlexFabric adapter.
With 10Gb FlexFabric Adapters on server blades and 
just two Virtual Connect FlexFabric 10Gb Modules or 
two VirtualConnect Flex-10/10D Modules,
you can eliminate HBAs on each server and 
Fibre Channel SAN switches in each HP BladeSystem enclosure.
Example: 10Gb FlexFabric Adapter
--------------------------------
The FlexibleLOM HP FlexFabric 10Gb 2-port 554FLB Adapter,
provides six FlexNIC and two FlexHBA connections or eight FlexNIC connections on each server.

The Virtual Connect FlexFabric Modules and 
Virtual Connect Flex-10/10D modules and 
FlexFabric Adapters
can converge Ethernet and Fibre Channel traffic from HP server blades.

So, instead of using separate Ethernet and Fibre Channel adapters and switches, 
both types of traffic are combined on a single wire from the server to the Virtual Connect module.

Two new standards are combined with Virtual Connect and Flex-10 technology to accomplish this:
? Fibre Channel over Ethernet (FCoE) 
encapsulates Fibre Channel frames
so they can be transmitted over network Ethernet.
? Data Center Bridging (DCB) improves Ethernet performance
to resemble the quality of a Fibre Channel network.
DCB has also been called Converged Enhanced Ethernet (CEE) and lossless Ethernet.

3. Configuration limitations
============================
NOTE: When using VC Flex-10 Modules with Flex-10 NICs on server blades,
only VC Ethernet modules may be used for Ethernet connections in the same enclosure.
